At the heart of this change, there is the fact that objects get *traversed by data*.

//ST: !
It's not just mechanics powered by electricity anymore.

It's mechanics, with computers, software (code), Internet connection and data flowing.

//ST: !
And this is what Internet of Things and smart objects are pretty much about.

//ST: !
This course is designed to make you *touch* this, feel confident about getting a job in this new economy.

You will need to use hardware, software, and see how data flows from the Internet to a tiny object.

//ST: !
You will need to visit the Makers Lab to solder some pieces.

Brightspace remains your meeting point, especially to read the syllabus and for the assignments.

So the 3 in-class sessions are devoted to kick-start, follow your progress and close the course.

//ST: !
Experts video are coming. We are finalizing the filming and they will be put online in October.

//ST: !
==== c. Assignments are short videos you should make.

//ST: !
